# Dynamic-Memory-Management-Visualizer
A visual and interactive simulator for understanding how operating systems allocate and deallocate memory using different dynamic allocation algorithms — First Fit, Best Fit, Worst Fit, and Next Fit. This tool visually represents memory blocks, holes, fragmentation, and block splitting/merging in real time.
